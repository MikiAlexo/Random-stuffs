            <h2>Basics</h2>
            <h2>How to register</h2>
            <p>First connect computer to the device using  a cable  then open the app called biometric attendance then 
                fill the required information on the specified location, then click the “Save” button. After that place
                 finger on the sensor and register then click the reset button on the device.</p>
            <h2>How to Attend</h2>  
                <p>When turning on the device it will automatically start to scan finger and the user can put finger on the
                 sensor and it will save time on the memory.  <p>
            <h2>How to remove user</h2>
                <p>You can remove user from the memory via the app and then going to the delete page and filling
                  the requirements. <p>
             <h2>Common errors</h2>
             <h2>Communication error</h2>
             <p> This usually occurs when the finger print sensor is not connected to the main circuit or when the sensor
                 is not working <p>
              <h2>Memory card not found</h2>
                <p>When this happens the device will automatically start to display time.
                 And this can be solved by inserting a memory card and then pressing the reset button. <p> 
              <h2>Time limit</h2>
                <p>When someone places their finger on the device it will not automatically save time, first it will check if the
                     person is within the time limit given by the owner. If the device displays something like “on time limit” 
                     that means that the device is temporally off and will not take attendance.  </p>    
              <h2>How to read files from memory</h2>
              <h2>Data base</h2>
              <p>Every data that was inserted in the app is stored inside the text file data base. It stores data such us Name,Id and salary.
                DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE because if you do so the entier attendance might stop working properly or entierly.<p>
             <h2> Absent</h2>
             <p>Absent-"Date" is where absent employees are stored to defferenciate them from the employees that came early 
                and to make it easier to take the absent people name and id.The file will be created daily and
                 the name will change each day in the format "Absent*Date*" and store data.the data of the previous day won't affect the current one
                 which makes it easier to understand. <p>
             <h2>*Month**Day*(attendance)</h2>
             <p>This is the file where the time in and out of the employee is stored and it is the data base for the identification of the absent employees.
                Editing this file is not recommended and it could affect the file that identifies the absent employees for the day. <p>        
             <h2>How to use the biometric attendance app</h2>
             <p>When you open the app for the first time you will find your self in the page called registeration form.
                This is the page where you can register employees. in order to register someone first full fill the reqiurements on that page
                then press the "save" button.
                On the left top corner you will find a button that has three lines and if you click it it will show to options.
                Depending on the page your on it will show "REGISTER","User manual" or "DELETE","User manual".If you press on the "delete" 
                button it will take you to the deliting page called DELETE REGISTEREE FORM,when you fullfill the form on that page and press "save"it will delete the 
                employee's data from the device's memory.
                At last there is a link callled "usermanual" where it will bring you to this offline page any time the user wants<p>
